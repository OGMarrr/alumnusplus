              Wicket is developed by Wicket Journeys _ a band of senior college
              students (from UCC) running on caffeine-injected three-hour
              sleeps, dreams of making it to the end of the semester, and hopes
              of alleviating employment issues in (Metro Manila/ the
              Philippines).
